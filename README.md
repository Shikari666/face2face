# face2face
A software which takes images of two people in real time and can take the expressions of person in 1st photo and mimics the same expression in the 2nd image.
We will provide a dataset to the machine so that the machine learns to distinguish between different expressions. 

In this software the machine learns from the facial landmarks and translates onto a face model. 
Here we will provide the machine with 2 images of two different people with different expressions, the machine will apply various 
algorithms to identify the facial expression on image 1 and depict the same expression on the face of the person in image 2. 
The same is used to create a video of the expression.

Tools/ Technologies used to build this software are:

1.Anaconda / Python 3.5
2.TensorFlow 1.2
3.OpenCV 3.0
4.Dlib 19.4
